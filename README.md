## Introduction

The File Downloader project demonstrates the use of **socket programming** to transfer files between two endpoints. It is a simple yet practical implementation of client-server communication, showcasing how sockets can be used for data transfer.

---

## How It Works

1. **Connection Setup**: The program sets up a socket connection between the source and destination.
2. **File Transfer**: The specified file is read from the source and sent to the destination.
3. **Completion**: The program ensures the file is fully transferred and closes the connection.
